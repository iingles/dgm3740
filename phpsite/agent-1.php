            </h2>
                <p>
                    I have loved travel for as long as I can remember.  At the age of 12 I asked if I could fly by myself to Hawaii and I never came back.

                    Right out of high school I started into travel school and have had the opportunity to work in many aspects of the industry.  In every aspect I have worked 
                    I have had the opportunity to help people travel, to help fulfil people's dreams, what could be better to do every day?
